                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel and finely slice the garlic.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Get a large pan of salted water on the boil. Melt the butter in a large ovenproof saucepan over
                        a low heat, then add the flour and turn the heat up to medium, stirring all the time, until you
                        get a paste – this is your roux.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Add all the sliced garlic – don’t worry about the amount because each slice will caramelise like
                        toffee in the roux. Keep cooking and stirring until golden and the garlic is nice and sticky.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Add the bay leaves and slowly whisk in the milk a little at a time to ensure you get a nice
                        smooth sauce. Bring the mixture to the boil, then leave it on a low heat to simmer and tick
                        away, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Add the pasta to the pan of boiling salted water and cook according to the packet instructions.
                        Meanwhile, roughly chop the tomatoes on a board and season them well with sea salt and black
                        pepper. Grate the Cheddar and Parmesan.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Drain the pasta and add it immediately to the sauce. Give it a good stir and take the pan off
                        the heat. Stir in your grated cheeses, chopped tomatoes and pick in half of the thyme leaves. A
                        little Worcestershire sauce added now is nice, and so is a little grating or two of nutmeg.Now
                        work on the flavour – taste it and season it until it’s hitting the right spot. You want it to
                        be slightly too wet because it will thicken up again in the oven, so add a splash of water if
                        needed.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>If you’ve made your sauce in an ovenproof casserole-type pan, leave everything in there; if not,
                        transfer it to a deep earthenware dish. Bake it for 30 minutes in the oven, until golden,
                        bubbling, crispy and delicious.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>While it’s cooking, put your breadcrumbs and the rest of the the thyme leaves into a pan with a
                        few drizzles of olive oil over a medium heat. Stir and toss the crumbs around until crunchy and
                        golden all over. Remove from the heat and tip into a nice bowl.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Serve your macaroni cheese in the centre of the table, with your bowl of crispy breadcrumbs for
                        sprinkling over, and a lovely green salad</li>
